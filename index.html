            Administration"</li>
        <br>
        <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">1935</span> - Has to stop school and save up more money. Works in the Civilian Conservation Corps, helping starving Americans. "I saw how food changed
            them", he said. "All of this left scars on me."</li>
        <br>
        <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">1937</span> - Finishes university and takes a job in the US Forestry Service</li>
        <br>
        <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">1938</span> - Marries wife of 69 years Margret Gibson. Gets laid off due to budget cuts. Inspired by Elvin Charles Stakman, he returns to school study under
            Stakman, who teaches him about breeding pest-resistent plants.</li>
        <br>
        <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">1941</span> - Tries to enroll in the military after the Pearl Harbor attack, but is rejected. Instead, the military asked his lab to work on waterproof glue, DDT
            to control malaria, disinfectants, and other applied science.</li>
        <br>
        <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">1942</span> - Receives a Ph.D. in Genetics and Plant Pathology</li>
        <br>
        <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">1944</span> - Rejects a 100% salary increase from Dupont, leaves behind his
            pregnant wife, and flies to Mexico to head a new plant pathology program. Over the next 16 years, his team breeds 6,000 different strains of disease resistent wheat - including different varieties for each major climate on
            Earth.</li>
        <br>
        <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">1945</span> - Discovers a way to grown wheat twice each season, doubling wheat
            yields</li>
        <br>
        <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">1953</span> - crosses a short, sturdy dwarf breed of wheat with a high-yeidling American breed, creating a strain that responds well to fertilizer. It goes on
            to provide 95% of Mexico's wheat.</li>
        <br>
        <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">1962</span> - Visits Delhi and brings his high-yielding strains of wheat to the Indian subcontinent in time to help mitigate mass starvation due to a rapidly
            expanding population</li>
        <br>
        <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">1970</span>  - receives the Nobel Peace Prize â€¢ 1983 - helps seven African countries dramatically increase their maize and
        sorghum yields</li>
        <br>
        <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">1984</span> - becomes a distinguished professor at Texas A&M University</li>
        <br>
        <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">2005</span> - states "we will have to double the world food supply by 2050." Argues that genetically modified crops are the only way we can meet the demand, as we run out of arable land. Says that GM crops are not inherently dangerous because "we've been genetically modifying plants and animals for a long time. Long before we called it science, people were selecting the
        best breeds."</li>
        <br>
        <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">2009</span> - dies at the age of 95.</li>
        
        <br>
        <br>

        <span style="font-style: italic;">"Borlaug's life and achievement are testimony to the far-reaching contribution that one man's towering intellect, persistence and scientific
vision can make to human peace and progress."</span>
